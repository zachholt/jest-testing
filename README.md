# Next.js + Jest

This example shows how to configure Jest to work with Next.js.

This includes Next.js' built-in support for Global CSS, CSS Modules and TypeScript. This example also shows how to use Jest with the App Router and React Server Components.

> **Note:** Since tests can be co-located alongside other files inside the App Router, we have placed those tests in `app/` to demonstrate this behavior (which is different than `pages/`). You can still place all tests in `__tests__` if you prefer.

## Deploy your own

## How to Use

Quickly get started using [Create Next App](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app#readme)!

In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-jest with-jest-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-jest with-jest-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-jest with-jest-app
```

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## About Tests

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. There is no visual components for this script, only code and tests. The current tests are located under calculateTotal.test.tsx and counter.test.tsx.

calculateTotal.test.tsx tests the calculateTotal function in the calculateTotal.ts file. Tests included are calculations and handling input.

counter.test.tsx tests the Counter component in the Counter.tsx file. Tests included are rendering, incrementing, and decrementing the counter.

Finally you can run npm run coverage to see the test coverage of the entire project.
